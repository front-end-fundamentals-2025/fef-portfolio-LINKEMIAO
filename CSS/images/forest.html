    <h2>Forest</h2>
    <h4>A forest is a diverse and thriving ecosystem dominated by a dense canopy of trees and undergrowth, providing a habitat for countless species of flora and fauna. Forests cover approximately one-third of the Earth's land area and play a vital role in regulating the global climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. They are categorized into various types, including tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and boreal forests, each with distinct climates, species, and ecological functions. Beyond their environmental significance, forests offer resources such as timber, medicine, and recreation while holding cultural and spiritual value for many communities. Rich in biodiversity and natural beauty, forests are essential for maintaining ecological balance and supporting life on Earth.</h4>
